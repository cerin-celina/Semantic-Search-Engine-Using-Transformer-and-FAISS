# Semantic-Search-Engine-Using-Transformer-and-FAISS
The main aim of the project is to develop a semantic search engine that surpasses the limitations of traditional keyword-based search. Here's a breakdown of the key objective:

Bridge the Gap Between Keywords and User Intent: Traditional search engines rely on matching keywords in the user query with keywords in documents. This often leads to irrelevant results if the query uses synonyms, paraphrases, or expresses a nuanced meaning that doesn't directly match existing keywords.

Leverage Transformers for Semantic Understanding: This project addresses this limitation by utilizing transformers, a powerful deep learning architecture. Transformers generate meaningful sentence embeddings that capture the semantic content of user queries and documents. These embeddings go beyond just keywords and represent the overall meaning of the text.

Achieve Efficient and Accurate Retrieval with FAISS: The project integrates FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to facilitate efficient retrieval of documents. FAISS excels at searching and clustering dense vectors, like the sentence embeddings generated by transformers. This allows the search engine to quickly identify documents with high semantic similarity to the user's query, even within a massive dataset.
